            <p>This is my own recipe for cranberry mead, inspired by my
                wife making cranberry sauce for Thanksgiving. The tartness
                of the cranberries really matches the sweet flavors.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>    
            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon of water</li>
                <li>3 lbs of honey (about 12 cups)</li>
                <li>1 lb of cranberries</li>
                <li>3 oranges juiced and zested</li>
                <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                <li>1 sachet of wine yeast (alternatively can use
                bakers yeast, but it is more unpredictable)
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Primary fermentation</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Bring your water to a boil</li>
                        <li>Slowly pour in the honey while mixing</li>
                        <li>Once all the honey has been added, let the water cool to about 100F</li>
                        <li>Add the yeast and mix</li>
                        <li>Put into fermenting container (carboy) for at least one month,
                            at most until it clears and you can see through the liquid
                        </li>
                        <li>Re-rack for secondary and add in the cranberry sauce</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>When in secondary, make the cranberry sauce</li>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat the cranberries, orange juice, orange zest, and sugar</li>
                        <li>The cranberries should naturally crush, but you may crush them yourself</li>
                        <li>Once to a boil, let it simmer, then cool</li>
                        <li>Add to the mead when cooled, and stir</li>
                    </ol>
                <li>You may want to monitor the acidity, as too much acid can kill yeast</li>
                <li>After at least another week, at most a month, re-rack again, removing the cranberries and other particulates</li>
                <li>Let sit until clear, then bottle or drink.</li>
            </ul>
