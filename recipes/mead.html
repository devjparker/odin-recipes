            <p>Mead is a faint honey wine with multiple types of
            recipes and flavors. A simple mead only needs
            honey, water, and yeast to ferment, but it is 
            best to have nutrients for the yeast to make
            well-rounded flavors.

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>    
            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon of water</li>
                <li>3 lbs of honey (about 12 cups)</li>
                <li>1 sachet of wine yeast (alternatively can use
                bakers yeast, but it is more unpredictable)
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>

                <li>Slowly pour in the honey while mixing</li>

                <li>Put into fermenting container (carboy) for at least one month,
                    at most until it clears and you can see through the liquid
                </li>
