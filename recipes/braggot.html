            <p>I've never made a braggot without guidance before, and last made one with family
                when I was a child. To the best of my memory, it's simply a mead made with beer methodology,
                thus it has malt and sometimes hops.

        <h3 class="left">Ingredients</h3>    
            <ul>
                <li>1 gallon of water</li>
                <li>2.5 lbs of honey</li>
                <li>0.5 lbs of dry malt extract (amber recommended)</li>
                <li>1 sachet of ale yeast (alternatively can use
                bakers yeast, but it is more unpredictable)
                </li>
            </ul>
        <h3 class="left">Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring your water to a boil</li>
                <li>Slowly pour in the honey and malt extract while mixing</li>
                <li>Once all the honey has been added, let the water cool to about 100F</li>
                <li>Add the yeast and mix</li>
                <li>Put into fermenting container (carboy) for at least one month,
                    at most until it clears and you can see through the liquid
                </li>
                <li>Optionally, you may re-rack the mead</li>
                <li>Bottle or drink</li>
            </ol>
